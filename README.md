# Castle-Combat

## Summary

A clone of the old arcade game [Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game)). Up to four players build castle walls, place cannons inside these walls, and attack their enemies. If a player cannot build a complete wall around one of his castles, he loses. The last surviving player wins.

The game can be played by two people at the same computer or with up to 4 players of the network.
